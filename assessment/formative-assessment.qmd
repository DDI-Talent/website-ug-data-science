As the formative part of your assessment, please use the TurnItIn box below submit a document with a link to your assessment website. On the assessment website, we'd like to see about 1 page of content. Ideally, this would include these three elements:

1) An indication of the topic (focus) of your data exploration

2) A data visualisation that represents a first stab at investigating your research question

3) A commentary about what the data visualisation depicts, and what you plan to do next

A key part of this formative exercise is for you to go through the steps to set up and update your assessment GitHub repository and website. This is why we insist on you submitting a link to your website. If you encounter any problems, please use the drop-in sessions to ask for help.

You can continue working on the assessment while you wait for feedback, but please don't push any changes to GitHub.
