For anything important that we want to load in and save, we write the code in our scripts so that we can bring back the data and objects into our environment whenever we want to by rerunning it - reproducibility in action!\nIt’s good practice to clear out our environment frequently, and always before starting new work (a bit like spring cleaning) to make sure there are no old objects we no longer need cluttering up space. If we didn’t clear the environment, we might accidentally end up using older data we thought had been updated.\nTo clear our environment we Restart R and it only takes a second!\nTo restart R you can do one of the following:\n\nUse the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+F10\nUse the dropdown menu Session -&gt; Restart R\n\n————–\nNote: RStudio has a default option for saving your environment, but that is not best practice anymore.

    "text": "How does R work?\nWhen using R, you will predominantly be working with your own data which you must first load in before you can start exploring it, and we’ll be covering how to do this in-depth in the next topic. But to begin with, let’s see how R works.\nNow that you have RStudio up and running, try copying the code from above these boxes and running them yourself in a new script.\nCan you remember what the # symbol does?\n\n# R is like a calculator\n7 + 3\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nThe # symbol allows us to add comments by letting R know not to run this line of text as R code.\nWhat if we want to save the value of this calculation to refer to at a later date?\n\nAssignment Operators\nTo save our value, we have to create an object, a, and then assign the value to the object using the = sign or alternatively, you could use these &lt;- symbol. They are both called assignment operators. In R there are often multiple ways of doing the same thing as you will continue to discover, and which you choose often depends on personal preference.\nMy preference is for the &lt;- because (a) it shows the direction of assignment (right to left) and (b) is distinct from = which can also be used within functions for specific arguments. But both work!\nTry adding and running the following code in your script. Why do you think we have to type a again on its own underneath?\n\n  # assign the results of our calculation to an object \"a\"\n  a &lt;- 7 + 3 \n  # print out the result\n  a \n\n[1] 10\n\n\nIt’s always worth remembering that in R:\n\nif you save an object, then the value does not get printed (displayed on the screen)\nif you print an object, then the value does not get saved\n\nIn our example above, the equals &lt;- sign tells R to give the object on the left of the sign the value of whatever is on the right of the sign, and the value gets saved. Underneath, where only a is typed, we are also printing it so that you can see the result. In this code chunk, we are both saving and printing.\nBut in our first example, there was no &lt;- sign so we were only printing the value, not saving it too.\nNote: When working in RStudio, when you save a value to an object it will appear in the Environment tab. If you haven’t given your values or data a name using an assignment operator, it won’t appear in the Environment tab.\n\n\nA Quick Aside on Names in R…\nYou can name objects in R anything that you like… well almost anything. There are a few rules about names in R:\n\nNo spaces - spaces inside a name are not allowed (the spaces around the &lt;- don’t matter):\nlucky_number &lt;- 5 ✔ lucky number &lt;- 5 ❌\nNames must start with a letter:\nlucky_number &lt;- 5✔1lucky_number &lt;- 5` ❌\nCase sensitive:\nlucky_number is different from Lucky_Number\nReserved words - there is a set of words you can’t use as names, including: if, else, for, in, TRUE, FALSE, NULL, NA, NaN, function (Don’t worry about remembering these, R will tell you if you make the mistake of trying to name a variable after one of these).\n\nFor more information on naming objects in R, check out this blog post.\n\n\nArithmetic Operators\nLet’s go one step further and save each of the values in our previous calculation ( 7 + 3 ) as objects too.\nIn the code chunk below you will see that we’ve added some more calculations. These include the most basic arithmetic operators we’ll be using and as you can see, R uses standard symbols.\nWhy might we want to save each of our values as objects first?\n\n# assign the values \"7\" and \"3\" to objects \"b\" and \"c\"\nb &lt;- 7\nc &lt;- 3\n\n# arithmetic operators\nadd_opr       &lt;- b + c\nsubtract_opr  &lt;- b - c\nmultiply_opr  &lt;- b * c\ndivide_opr    &lt;- b / c\n\n# print out the results\nadd_opr\n\n[1] 10\n\nsubtract_opr\n\n[1] 4\n\nmultiply_opr\n\n[1] 21\n\ndivide_opr\n\n[1] 2.333333\n\n\nSaving our values as objects allows us to carry out various calculations using one set of saved values. If we want to change the value of b or c, we can do so without having to change the values in all subsequent calculations too.\nWhy not try it just now? Change the value of b to 9 ( b &lt;- 9 ) and rerun the chunk to see your updated results.\nRemember, the name on the left of the &lt;- is the object name. Now change the name of one of the objects, but make sure you also change the name in the code for printing the results too.\nAll of R is just an extension of these types of processes: applying more complex functions (calculations) across more complex objects.\nIt’s important to appreciate that objects can be more than just single numbers. They can be entire spreadsheets, which in R tidyverse are known as tibbles. These are the types of objects you will predominantly be working with when analysing healthcare data.\nYou can find further examples of the arithmetic/mathematical operators in R via the introverse package documention.\n\n\nRelational or Comparison Operators\nAs well as performing calculations with arithmetic operators, you can also ask R things, such as is “2 greater than 10?”. In such cases, as you are asking R a questions, the output returned (or answer) is TRUE or FALSE. Another set of operators you will use frequently in R are relational operators, which are great for comparing values and for creating subgroups in your data or excluding outliers.\nNote: You can find a full list of the operators we use on the HealthyR Quick-start cheatsheet, also listed in Further Resources) for this week.\nThese operators allow us to ask questions about our data. For example, are values in a column greater than, less than or equal to a reference value?\nThe symbols used by different programs and languages for logical operators vary more widely than for arithmetic operators, let’s see what R uses, examples are shown in the following code chunk:\n\n# Assign values to \"x\" and \"y\"\nx &lt;- 3\ny &lt;- 7\n\n# Greater than\n2 &gt; 10\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# Less than\nx &lt; y\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Equal to\nx == y\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n# Not equal to\nx != y\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Greater than or equal to\nx &gt;= 3\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# Less than or equal to\n4 &lt;= x\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nThe == is very easily and commonly confused with the =. If you get an error when trying to compare values to see if they are equal, there is a good chance you have forgotten to put in the extra =.\nPrinting out a TRUE or FALSE value might seem a bit obscure, but these relational or comparison operators are really useful for filtering data and we’ll use them frequently throughout this course.\n\n\nLogical Operators\nA final set of operators that you will find useful when working with data in R is the logical set of operators. These work in a very similar way to the relational operators: R compares values and returns TRUE or FALSE as the output. You can think of logical operators are asking R to compare 2 or more things. \nYou can find further examples of the logical operators in R via the introverse package documentation.\nLet’s see how this works:\n\n  # assign multiple values to the object \"year\" \n  year &lt;- c(2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004)\n \n  # check \"year\" values to see if they are equal to 2000 OR 2001 \n  year == 2000 | year == 2001\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n  # | for \"OR\"\n  year_subset1 &lt;- year == 2000 | year == 2001\n  year_subset1\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n  # & for \"AND\" \n  year_subset2 &lt;- year &gt; 2001 & year &lt; 2003\n  year_subset2\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n  # ! for \"NOT\" \n  year_subset3 &lt;- !year == 2002\n  year_subset3\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n\n\n\nData Types\nLike many other types of analysis, database, or spreadsheet software, R needs to know what the variable type (or data type) of each column is. The types we’ll be using most frequently are characters, factors, and numbers.\n\nCharacters\nCharacters (sometimes referred to as strings or character strings) in R are letters, words, or even whole sentences (an example of this might be free text comments). We can convert objects or values to character data type using the function as.character(). Characters are displayed in-between \"\" (or '').\n\n\nFactors\nFactors can be thought of as slightly fussy characters. They’re fussy because they have something called levels. Levels are all the unique values this variable could take e.g. if we have a column with data on sex, there might be two levels, “Male” and “Female” or there might be three levels if there was an option to specify “Other” too. Using factors rather than just characters can be useful because:\n\nThe values that factor levels can take is fixed. For example, if the predefined levels of your column called sex are “Male” and “Female” and you try to add a new patient where sex is just called “F” sex was stored as a character data type rather than a factor, R would have no problem with this and you would end up with “Male”, “Female”, and “F” in your column.\nLevels have an order. By default, R sorts things alphabetically, but if you want to use a non-alphabetical order, e.g. if we had a body_weight variable where we want the levels to be ordered - “underweight” - “normal weight” - “overweight” - we need to make body_weight into a factor. Making a character column into a factor enables us to define and change the order of the levels.\n\nThese are huge benefits, especially as a lot of medical data analyses include the comparison of different risks to a reference level.\n\n\nNumbers\nIn R, we specify numbers using the as.numeric() function. Sometimes numerics are further differentiated based on whether they have decimal places or not. Integer stands for a number without decimal places, whereas double would have decimal places.\n\n\nDate\nDates can be confusing, they can appear in many different formats, and in R they can look very similar to the character data type because they too are displayed between inverted commas ( \"\" ). Once we let R know that our variable is a date however, it can do some clever things as we’ll discover later.\nYou can find out more about how R reads in dates and also more examples on all these other data types by going to Chapter 2.2 in R for health data analysis.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "When coding in R it is normal to spend a large part of your time dealing with error messages. This is the same whether you are a beginner or advanced R user. It can be time consuming trying to decipher these error messages and also very frustrating. Troubleshooting error messages is a skill in itself but it does get easier, promise!\nHere are a few tips which will hopefully help to speed up the process. First, here’s a quick checklist, with more detail included below.\n\ncheck you’ve not done something daft (spelling, comma, bracket, etc.)\nreally look at the error message for clues (sometimes they’re surprisingly helpful)\nRestart R and try running the code again (this is often very successful)\nif using an unfamiliar function - check documentation (F1)\ntry Googling the error message directly (Google is actually quite clever)\ntry simplifying your code and run smaller chunks (build from what you know works)\nask a fellow R user or the community (Slack: NHS-R or R4DS)\n\nMost of the error messages that you see will be because there’s a typo or other minor issue like a misspelled word, or forgotten a bracket or comma, or typed one = instead of two ==. So quickly check over your code to see if any of these might be the culprit first. Watch out for capitalisation (case sensitivity); R does recognise upper and lower case.\nTake a closer look at your error message to see if it might be helpful in working out what has gone wrong. Error messages can look a bit daunting at first. Aside from the alarming red text, the error messages often include unfamiliar words, but hidden amongst this, you will often find some more useful plain English or a hint as to what might be wrong. For example, the error messages will often let you know which line your code broke down on and there is also a visual reference shown alongside your code, indicated by a red line and cross.\nUnfortunately, warnings are also printed in the same red font. In many cases, warnings can be safely ignored. Especially if the output, whether a plot or a table, otherwise looks like what you’d expect it to look like. \nRestart R and do this often! There is no harm in restarting R, you will not lose any work as all of your code is written down, ready to be run again at the click of a button (or press of a keyboard shortcut). The joy of reproducibility! It is good practice to restart R often as a messy environment can cause unexpected behaviour, particularly when you are starting your analysis and still slightly undecided on the best object names to use so might change them a number of times before settling.\nWhen trying out a new function, make sure you know how it works and have explored examples of the function “in action”.You can check the documentation (press F1 with cursor inside function name), and scroll down to the bottom to see code examples. Google will also provide you with copious examples of how a function might be used. Or another way of finding the most relevant help is to restrict your search to more recent years. For ggplot2, dplyr, assignment operators, and many other introductory R topic-related questions, there is also the new introverse package which provides beginner-oriented help to complement the official documentation.\nIf you have no clue why you are getting a particular error message, it can be worth copying and pasting the error messages directly into Google. This can help to give some indication as to why your code isn’t working and then you can start to refine your search to make it more relevant. Try to remove text which is specific to your own project,e.g., your specific file or variable name, although often Google is clever enough to ignore these anyway.\nIf you’re still struggling to work out what’s going on, you can always ask someone.A friendly colleague is best, even if they’re not an “R expert” a second pair of eyes can often spot that extra ” or missing ) you’re too tired to see.\nThere are several online communities for free R help:\n\nhttps://community.rstudio.com/ (search through existing questions, or post your own, everyone is really friendly there)\nhttps://www.rfordatasci.com/ - join the Slack group\nAlternatively, there’s a similar group for those who identify as a woman or gender minority: https://rladies.org/\nFind further events and training course from the NHS-R community: https://nhsrcommunity.com/\n\nFollow the #rstats hashtag on Twitter, and when posting about R on Twitter, use this hashtag so other people can find your Tweet.",

    "section": "Health data: what, why, where and how",
    "text": "Health data: what, why, where and how\n\nWhat is health data\nHealth data refers to any kind of data related to health conditions, reproductive outcomes, causes of death and quality of life for an individual or population. This includes biometric information, prescription data, diagnoses and screening test results, as well as data about hospital visits or sleeping and exercise patterns. There is a shift lately in thinking more broadly about health, and in addition to clinical data, this also includes environmental (e.g. pollution levels), socioeconomic (e.g. income level) and lifestyle information. In fact, it is not uncommon nowadays to consider things that are not traditionally associated with health, such as social media posts (e.g. researchers have used data science methods to detect signs of depression in tweets). In this course, we will adopt such an open-minded view of health data.\n\n\nSources of health data\nThere are lots of different sources of health data. Clinical data is produced in hospitals and it is stored in hospital information systems, picture archiving and communication systems, laboratory databases, etc. Clinical data is also produced in primary care (e.g. GP practices in the UK) and stored in local systems. \nBiomedical research data, such as clinical trial data, is produced by academia and pharmaceutical companies and it is stored in databases and libraries. \nHealth business data (e.g. around accounting, billing, management, etc.) is produced by healthcare providers, insurance companies and other organisations, and is typically stored in local information and transaction systems. \nFinally, there is a growing volume of patient-generated data. This includes data produced by wearable devices (e.g. activity trackers that capture data including heart rate, steps and calories) and web-based apps and platforms (e.g. self-management platforms for conditions like diabetes or cancer), among others. This data is typically stored on the cloud or in local databases of the corresponding companies. One of the challenges in health data science is that data currently sits in silos. This means that data from different sources is not integrated. In fact, even data within a single healthcare provider is often fragmented and not joined up.\n\n\nHealth data levels\nHealth data can be captured at different levels, from the microscopic world (e.g. genomics, epigenomics, metagenomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to individuals (e.g. data captured in electronic patient records) and populations (e.g. data about disease spreading across different communities). The data published on the WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard is an example of population-level data. \nA large volume of data is produced at all these levels. For example, we estimate many terabytes of genomic data for each individual. Considering the size of the world population, this is really “big data”. Data generated by sensors in wearable devices is also very big, as they continuously generate data. Medical imaging data (e.g. X-rays) are also very heavy, making it challenging to store and computationally expensive to analyse.\n\n\nData forms\nHealth data comes in lots of different forms, from highly structured to unstructured data. Relational databases e.g. in hospital information systems provide a clear structure to data captured. You can think of a relational database as a collection of tables with rows and columns and links between them (e.g. you could have a Patient table containing demographic information about thousands of patients, a Hospital table with key information about different hospitals in Scotland, and an Admissions table with information about hospital admissions while pointing to the other two tables). \nData captured in spreadsheets also has some structure, but very often there is redundancy or duplication of information captured. \nEven less structure is present in clinical notes, which is natural language data, or in medical images. The lack of clear structure in the way this data is captured makes it harder to analyse and make sense of in an automated fashion. It is also very important to note that the choice of a data representation paradigm, and its underlying structure or absence of, can play a key role in data integration and linkage.\n\n\nBenefits of analysing data\nAnd why is it important to analyse health data? Learning more from data can contribute to important discoveries that allow us to better understand disease and improve the way we deliver care. This includes improved diagnostics, better decision-making and more effective predictions, among others.",

It focuses on identifying the most effective strategy for each patient, based on genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.\nThe ability to characterise individuals much more precisely then allows us to identify key differences across human populations and to act accordingly in healthcare provision – this is stratified healthcare. So, one can consider stratified healthcare and precision medicine to go hand-in-hand.\nHealth data science is a key enabler to the development of precision medicine and stratified healthcare. By bringing different types of data together for each patient, we can take a more personalised approach to therapies, tailoring them to suit each individual.

Most of your R code will appear between two sets of back ticks like the example above.\nWatch out for unpaired or rogue sets of back ticks as these can cause errors or strange behaviour and can sometimes be hard to spot.\nWe can run each individual chunk of code by clicking on the green arrow at the top-right of the code chunk. However, the usual Keyboard Shortcut of Control+Enter to run a line is still essential too. It is faster than moving your hand back from the keyboard to the mouse and navigating to this button. Furthermore, this means that if you have several lines in your code chunk, you can run each line separately which helps with fixing errors. The keyboard shortcut for running all lines in a code chunk is Control+Shift+Enter.\n\nBut what about the output? Where does it appear?\nSimilar to when we were working in an R Script, if we save our output as an object it isn’t displayed until we “print” it, but if we only “print” it and don’t assign our code to an object, then our output is only displayed.\nWhen we run code in R Markdown, instead of our output appearing in the console or plotting tab, it appears directly below the code chunk. Our saved objects still appear in the Environment tab.\nR Markdown behaviour is slightly more complicated however, because as well as having the option to run our the code in the ways shown, we can also “knit” our document to see what our finished report will look like. When this happens, the “knitting” process essentially creates a new self-contained environment, separate to the Environment tab we see in RStudio, so any objects assigned will not appear in our Environment tab unless we run them separately. More on this shortly.\nTo add an R chunk, rather than manually entering back ticks and curly brackets, the easiest way is simply to click on the Insert shortcut at the top of your document and select R.\n\nTo run an R chunk, we’ve already mentioned the green arrow within each code chunk. There are other ways to run your code and these can be found in the Run shortcut at the top of your document.",

    "text": "How do I write in Markdown?\nMarkdown is very simple to learn and you may even have been using it without knowing if you have ever formatted your text in a WhatsApp message. For example, we can put an underscore (_) on either side of a word to italicise it.\nHere is a link to an online tutorial which provides a very nice introduction to using Markdown and will take about 10 minutes to complete: Markdown tutorial. The RStudio website also has a self-paced online tutorial introducing RMarkdown as well as an (recently updated) handy RMarkdown Cheatsheet and an older (slightly less overwhelming) version of the cheatsheet.\nThere is also a very handy Markdown Quick Reference guide in the Help menu in RStudio if you need a reminder. I use this a lot.\nSome aspects of formatting we can control with Markdown include:\n\nHeadings\nText emphasis (bold or italic)\nLists\nImages\nLinks\n\nIt’s worth noting a slight quirk when writing in Markdown that a new line does not output a new line - to create a new line you have to leave an empty line.",

But individual hospitals have been in touch and have asked for a report with only their data.\nR Markdown to the rescue! It is possible to produce this in an R Markdown document with very little effort thanks to the use of parameters.\nInstead of manually editing each report, we can use parameters to automatically summarise the data for different hospitals or NHS Health Boards.\nThe input (parameter variable) is included in the YAML header by adding in params: then underneath is information about the name and input value of our parameter.\n\nHere we’re showing the YAML (header) from an example of a life expectancy report on the gapminder dataset. We’ve created a parameter to enable us to switch between reports for different continents easily.\nThe indentations are very important in the YAML, unlike in R code, so be careful with this. Also check that your colons are in the right place too ( : ).\nIf we find ourselves parameterising a document we have already created which was based on one continent’s data, we can simply search (Ctrl + F works here) the document for any mention of the continent and update.\nFor object names we can change the text to make it more generic.\nWhere we have referred to the value of a specific continent in our R code, for example in a filter, we need to update with params$continent where params is letting R know to look in the YAML for a parameter, and continent is telling R to use whatever value appears in this parameter.\nHere is a code chunk from our document before parameterisation.\n\nHere is the edited code chunk after an update to refer to the parameter listed in the YAML.\n\nHere is some descriptive text before parameterisation:\n\nHere is the edited descriptive text after an update to refer to the parameter listed in the YAML:\n\nNote the use of the r here to let R know the following text is R code. This is because these lines don’t appear within a code chunk (between the two sets of ```).",

The answer is very little!\nR Notebook is one of the many output types that an R Markdown file can produce, so when you select R Notebook, the output part of the YAML will already say output: html_notebook.\nInteracting with an R Notebook is slightly different to that of an R Markdown document. When executing chunks in an R Markdown document, all the code is sent to the console at once, but in an R Notebook, only one line at a time is sent. This allows execution to stop if a line raises an error.",
