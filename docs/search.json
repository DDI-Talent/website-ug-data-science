    "text": "Course Name: Data Science for Health and Biomedical Sciences\nCourse Code: BIME10076\nSCQF Credits: 20\nLink to course on DRPS: http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/24-25/dpt/cxbime10076.htm\n\nCourse Handbook\nData Science 2024-25 Handbook_FINAL.docx\n\n\n\nCourse Outline\nThe course aims to provide a broad introduction to data science in health and biomedical sciences, covering key concepts and principles, data analysis skills and implications of working with biomedical and healthcare data. Key topics in the course include: types of human health data; computational methods (e.g. process modelling and machine learning); data wrangling, analysis and reporting using the R programming language; legal considerations and bias in health data. This course is delivered in a flipped classroom format: it is based around short pre-recorded videos, which are complemented with readings and self-guided programming tasks. The students also have a weekly in-person tutorial, which provides an opportunity for further improvement of their programming practice and discussion of the core concepts. We will also offer weekly quizzes to provide the students with valuable formative feedback.\nLearning Outcomes\nOn completion of this course, the student will be able to:\n\nApply a range of specialised data science techniques to different medical and healthcare scenarios.\nAnalyse health and biomedical data with the use of the R programming language, including summarisation, visualisation and interpretation.\nCritically examine the ethical, societal and regulatory principles and implications of data science in health.\nExplain and critically discuss key concepts, principles and methods of data science in health.\n\nRecommended Reading & Resources\nThere is no compulsory course text.\nHowever, we recommended:\n\nR for Health Data Science (free online) by Ewen Harrison and Riinu Pius\nR for Data Science (free online) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund\nValue Sensitive Design by Batya Friedman and David G. Hendry (available from the Library)\n\n\n\nTimetable\nYou can find class times for this course via your University of Edinburgh calendar (links open in a new window):\n\nView your calendar in Office 365\nInformation about Student Timetables\n\nEssential Course Guide\nThis is general information that applied to all BMTO courses.\nhttps://www.ed.ac.uk/biomedical-sciences/bmto/bmto-undergraduate-students/academic-guidance-and-support/academic-guidance/student-guide/biomedical-sciences-undergraduate-student-handbook\nCourse Handbook\nYou can find the course handbook here (PDF and docx versions) -&gt; https://github.com/DDI-Students/data-science-for-health-bms-24-25/blob/main/documents/.
