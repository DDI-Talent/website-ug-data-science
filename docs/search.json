    "text": "Welcome!\nIn this course you will be introduced to data science techniques used in health and biomedicine, you’ll have a chance to practice these techniques in R, and you’ll learn about the social and societal issues surrounding the increased use of data science in human health. The course will be taught in a flipped classroom format: each week, you will be given a set of videos and readings to go through at home, and in the live sessions on Thursdays and Fridays we’ll discuss and practice what you learned from those materials. It is therefore crucial that you do complete the required preparation work before class; otherwise, you will not be able to fully participate.\nThe course materials have been prepared for you by various staff from the Usher Institute and the wider College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine. The two weeks focused on data ethics will be delivered in collaboration with two experts in this topic: Dr Kevin Guyan from the Business School and Dr Max Perry from the School of Social and Political Science.\nWe look forward to working with you!"
