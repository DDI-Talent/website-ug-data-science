#### **Course Outline**

The course aims to provide a broad introduction to data science in health and biomedical sciences, covering key concepts and principles, data analysis skills and implications of working with biomedical and healthcare data. Key topics in the course include: types of human health data; computational methods (e.g. process modelling and machine learning); data wrangling, analysis and reporting using the R programming language; legal considerations and bias in health data. This course is delivered in a flipped classroom format: it is based around short pre-recorded videos, which are complemented with readings and self-guided programming tasks. The students also have a weekly in-person tutorial, which provides an opportunity for further improvement of their programming practice and discussion of the core concepts. We will also offer weekly quizzes to provide the students with valuable formative feedback.

**Learning Outcomes**

On completion of this course, the student will be able to:

1.  Apply a range of specialised data science techniques to different medical and healthcare scenarios.

2.  Analyse health and biomedical data with the use of the R programming language, including summarisation, visualisation and interpretation.

3.  Critically examine the ethical, societal and regulatory principles and implications of data science in health.

4.  Explain and critically discuss key concepts, principles and methods of data science in health.
