## Fine-tuning plots

### Overview

The purpose of this topic is to introduce you to some of the finer points of plotting in ggplot2. The icing on the cake. You've mastered the basics but perhaps you want more flexibility over the axes ranges, or you want to add in an annotation, or zoom into sections of your plot, or use more aesthetically pleasing colour palettes.

The exercises you'll be working through are included in an R Markdown document which you can download and open in RStudio, similar to the sessions in previous weeks.

### Plotting Practice

#### Remember to begin by creating a new project in RStudio.

Then download the R Markdown document, navigate to your newly created project folder, and save.

finetuning_plots.Rmd

Have fun!
