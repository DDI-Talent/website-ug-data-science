This week we will be learning more about factors and joins, how to fine-tune our plots, and taking an overview of what an analysis project in R might look like Learning Outcomes

## By the end of the week you will be able to:

1.  Explain the difference between the data types factor and character

2.  Join two datasets together using various joins

3.  Carry out fine-tuning of your plots using functions in ggplot2

4.  Demonstrate the steps required to start analysing and reporting on your own data

## **Structure of this week's materials**

1.  Wrangling factors and joins: 1 reading with code samples

2.  Fine-tuning plots: 1 reading, 1 practice

3.  Roundup and recap: 1 reading with code samples
