Each week, you will be given a set of readings, videos and exercises to complete. These are designed to help you understand the material and to prepare you for the tutorials and assignment.

In-person tutorials will be held on Thursday and Friday afternoons from 2-5pm. During the tutorials you will work in pairs to complete coding exercises together. This is called **pair programming** and is an effective and fun way to learn to code. The tutorials are an important part of the course and you are expected to attend.

It is important to complete the material before the tutorials, as the exercises will build on the material covered in the videos and readings. The tutorials will be a chance to ask questions and to get help with the exercises.

There will also be a quiz at the beginning of each tutorial to informally test your understanding of the material and discuss in your pairs.
