## RStudio Interface

Now that you have access to RStudio you can start using it to experiment with the exercises we cover this week. Throughout the materials, there are chunks of code for you to run. Try copying the code from these chunks directly into RStudio to reproduce the examples and continue your explorations. It is through **experimentation** that we learn most effectively.

As a quick reminder, the image below shows you where to go to open up a new script in RStudio. Then you can start writing your own code and running it.
