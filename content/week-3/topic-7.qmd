## Git...? GitHub...?

### What is Git?

Git is a **version control system**. It helps you:

-   Keep track of every change you make to your files
-   Go back to older versions if something breaks
-   Collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work

Really, Git is a command line tool. That is, it was originally designed to be used by typing text command into the command line. However, RStudio has some Git integration, that gives us a point and click interface that makes the whole think more friendly.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website that hosts your Git repositories online. It lets you:

-   Store your project backups in the cloud
-   Share your work or collaborate with others
-   Access your code from anywhere

So, in short, if Git is the version control tool, GitHub is like GoogleDrive for your Git repositories.

### Using Git and GitHub

The following guide will walk you through the process of setting up a repo on gitHub.

The only prerequisite for this is that you have already signed up for a Github account. If you have not already created one, do so now <https://github.com/signup>.

GitHub is an on-line platform for storing code or other text based projects, in **repositories** (repos). Each week you will create a new repository for your work in the tutorials. We will go through the process of setting up a repo step by step.

This is the process you should follow **every week** in your pair programming tutorials. Choose one person who will do this, on their own computer, and work through the steps together. Only do this on **that one person's computer**. Don't worry, all members of the team will get all work at the end, and all individuals will get a chance to do these steps on their own computer in future weeks.

Git has a whole vocabulary of its own. There is a glossary available that you can have open as you work through these notes [Git glossary](git-glossary.html)

## Github

### Creating a new repo in GitHub

-   Sign into your GitHub account here <https://github.com>.
-   Navigate to the repositories tab in your GitHub account.

![Github Repositories tab](images/git-r/01_gh_repos-tab.png){#fig-repos-tab}

-   Click the big green button to create a new repository.

![Click "New" to begin creating a repo](images/git-r/02_gh_new-repo-button.png){#fig-new-repo-button width="35%"}

This will take you to the repo initialization page.

### Initializing your repo

You can ignore the "template" section. If you are a keen bean, you can explore this later. It will allow you to create a template repo for all future weeks based on this week's repo. But we will not go over it here.

-   Give your repo a **meaningful** name.
    -   `tutorial-repo` sounds good, right? ðŸ¤¨...?

![Naming your repo. Don't forget to give a description.](images/git-r/03_gh_name-repo.png){#fig-name-repo}

-   Also fill in the **Description**.
    -   It says "optional", but fill it in now for benefits later.
    -   More detail = more benefit.

If we follow the defaults, we will create a completely blank repo. That's fine, and sometimes may be what you want. But lets make gitHub do some of the tedious bits for us (@fig-init-repo).

-   Tick the `add README file` box
-   click the `add .gitignore` drop-down and find your language of choice (if you need a clue, its **R**).
-   We can leave the license as **none** for now.
    -   But you should totally consider adding a license for personal projects, and definitely for any future research projects.

![Add a readme - whatever you wrote in your description abouve will be placed here automatically. Also, select the `.gitignore` file appropriate for `R`.](images/git-r/04_gh_init-repo.png){#fig-init-repo}

And click the big green button at the bottom.

![Click "Create repository"](images/git-r/05_gh_create-repo.png){#fig-create-repo}

### Preparing to "clone" the repository {#preparing-to-clone-the-repository}

After clicking the green button, you will be taken to a new page. This is your new repo. However, it so far is only accessible form GitHub. To make use of it we need to obtain a copy of it on our local machine. the process for doing this is called **cloning**.

-   Locate the next big green button - it says `Code` - and click.\
-   You will see a web URL with a copy icon next to it. Click the copy icon.

![Copy the repo URL after clicking the "Code" button.](images/git-r/06_gh_get-clone-link.png){#fig-get-clone-link}

## The terminal ðŸ˜¨

### Don't panic - only one command

Decide on a good place to save all your course resources. It is up to you where you want these to live, but make sure it makes sense to you, e.g.:

-   Desktop = bad
-   Somewhere in Documents = better

See @fig-dir-str at the end for a suggested set-up. You can create a new directory (folder) using whichever file manager you like, e.g. Windows Explorer, Mac Finder, terminal, etc.

-   Here I created folder in `Documents` called `data-science-tutorials`.
-   I then right-clicked inside the folder in Windows explorer and clicked `Open in terminal`...
-   ...and pasted the web URL copied from GitHub

![Paste the repo URL nto your terminal. The repo will be cloned in whixhever directory you are in when you do this, so make sure you are in the directory you want to be in!](images/git-r/01_term_create-local-repo-dir.png){#fig-create-local-repo-dir}

Press enter, to perform the clone. Once completed you will be shown a short summary. What it says is not important, but go ahead and read it as an optional exercise; see what you can glean.

![Pressin genter will insruct Git to download the repo.](images/git-r/02_term_clone-repo.png){#fig-clone-repo}

Success! And that's the only interaction with the terminal we need.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## RStudio

At this point we now have a repo on the GitHub cloud storage platform.\
And we have clone (copied) it to our local computer.\
Now we want to write our R code for the repo inside an RStudio project.\
This will be mostly familiar, but follow along anyway, because there may be a few points that are slightly different.

### Setting Up the project in RStudio

-   Create a new project
    -   Either `File > New project`
    -   Or click the `New project` drop-down @new-proj

![The `Project` drop-down menu can be used for creaing new projects.](images/git-r/01_rs_new-proj.png){#fig-new-proj}

-   In the menu that opens, select **`Existing Directory`**

![We already have a porject directory. It jsut has no prject in it. So select "Existing Directory" for creating your project.](images/git-r/02_rs_existing-dir.png){#fig-existing-dir}

Remember, we cloned our repo somewhere, possibly in `Documents/`...

-   Use the `Browse` button to find your repo.
-   When you have found it click `Create Project`.

![Use the browse button to find the locaton you cloned your repo to.](images/git-r/03_rs_create-project.png){#fig-git-tracked-project}

### Check out out new Git tracked R projects

Open the `Files` pane, and you will see that a few things that are different from the usual state of a new project.

-   A `.git` folder
    -   Don't mess with this!
    -   If you're one of the afore mentioned keen beans, by all means, have sniff around it, but know that most mortals have little need to tamper with anything in there.
-   A `README.md` file
    -   This is the readme file from GitHub
    -   You can edit this if you like - it's just a text file and it uses markdown syntax
-   A `.gitignore` file
    -   We will take a closer look at this shortly.

![Your project already contains the files you used to initialise itin GitHub](images/git-r/04_rs_git-tracked-project.png){#fig-git-pane}

### RStudio-Git integration

Now that we are using Git with RStudio, we should be able to find a Git pane (@fig-first-commit). By default, I think it appear in the top left panel of Rstudio. It may be somewhere else, so if you don't see it, check the other panels

The desire outcome here, is:

1.  Identify which files we want Git to track
    -   We don not have to track all files.
2.  Mark them as files of interest
    -   Called "adding them to the index".
3.  Commit them
    -   It is only **after this point** that Git starts tracking the files.

One you have found the Git pane, you should see two files listed with some yellow squares ![yellow question mark](images/git-r/rs-git-icon-untracked.png) and a check-box next to them.

This is how we tell Git to track and changes to files. We can choose which files we want git to track by ticking the check-box.

In this case we do want to track both files, so tick **both check-boxes** and the ![untracked yellow question mark](images/git-r/rs-git-icon-untracked.png) should become green squares with `A` inside ![added green A](images/git-r/rs-git-icon-added.png).

![The Git pane only appear if you are in a Git tracked directory. So you may have never seen it beore. It canusually be found in the top right panel of RStudio.](images/git-r/05_rs_git-pane.png){#fig-first-commit}

-   Then click the `Commit` button.
-   Add a commit message
    -   No need to be too laconic here.
    -   Make it meaningful. Detail is good.
    -   Click `Commit`.

![Add a descriptive commit message. More detail is good here, especially as your project ages. It will allow you to make sense of historical commits, like if you... need to find that time... you did that thing...](images/git-r/06_rs_first-commit.png){#fig-first-commit}

-   You will then be given a short summary or the commit
-   Click close
-   Checkout the Git pane again - it should now be empty?

![If your commit succeeds you will be given a short summary. If it fails, you may need to call in some support.](images/git-r/08_rs_commit-success.png){#fig-commit-success width="60%"}

### Let's change something

-   Find the `.gitignore` file in your `Files` pane, and click on it.
-   Add two lines at the end of the file.
    -   `.DS_Store`
    -   `thumbs.db`

**No matter what computer you are using, add both lines.** Your `.gitignore` file should now look like @fig-git-ignore

![.DS_Store files often crop up in reos. They are Mac only files and they are a nuisance for your repo. Add them to your `.gitignore` everytime. Windows has a similar file, but it seems to be less pervasive.](images/git-r/09_rs_gitignore.png){#fig-git-ignore width="50%"}

### Commit cyle

Once again, take a look at the Git pane. We should see that the `.gitignore` file has appeared again. This time instead of ![untracked yellow question mark](images/git-r/rs-git-icon-untracked.png), it has a blue square with `M` inside ![modified blue M](images/git-r/rs-git-icon-modified.png) inside.

This is Git saying

> You know that file you asked me to track? Well it's changed

Go through the process again of adding the file, writing a commit message, and committing the changes.

We have just completed the "commit cycle". This is the most basic and important workflow to learn in Git. Committing is a bit like saving - it's something you should do often!

![Get used to the Git commit cycle. Work \> Save \> Commit \> back to work. And do it often.](images/git-r/01_git_commit-cycle.png){#fig-commit-cycle}

### Push: Lets share our work with the world

Make sure you have committed all changes that you need to make sure your team mates will get the most up to date version. This is the same as (@fig-first-commit, but with an extra step: click `Push`.

![Another commit message. Do not use the same commit message as shoen here. A commit message needs to describe the changes that happened. What might be more meaningful here?](images/git-r/07_rs_first-commit-and-push.png){#fig-commit-and-push}

![The summary you see after a push tells you that your have pushed the changes on `HEAD` (your local version) to `main` the remote version](images/git-r/10_rs_push-success.png){#fig-push-success width="60%"}

But what does that actually do? It sends (pushes) our work to the GitHub cloud platform, and because our repos are public, the whole world can access it.

It allows a break form the commit cycle, in that once you push, your work is now backed up remotely, as well as saved locally.

![Commit cycle with the added `Push` step](images/git-r/02_git_commit-cycle-with-push.png){#fig-commit-cycle}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Forking: How do I get the work?

Maybe the world doesn't want our work... But our team mates probably do. The process for getting it is similar to the **clone** operation we did earlier. With a clone we copy the remote repo to our own machine, and our local copy maintains a "hard link" to the original. This means that if you make any changes locally, when you push, those changes will be sent to the original repo. An alternative is to create a **"fork"**. Doing this means we still make a copy of the repo, but instead of copying to out local machine, we can create our own copy in our own GitHub account. We can then **clone** our own copy of the repo, and any changes we push will update the copy in our own account, instead of the original.

So, to create a fork we navigate to the original repo, and find the **fork** button. Note that anyone can fork any public repo... you can fork the `ggplot2` repo if you like!

![The **fork** button in the GutHub navbar. Located just above the green \_\_code-- button we use to **clone** a repo.](images/git-r/12_gh_forking.png)

Clicking the fork button will take us to a screen very similar to the one we saw when we cloned earlier: we need to choose an "owner" and give the fork a name.

-   Change the owner to yourself, if it does not already show your name.
-   Name your fork
    -   You can choose any name you like
    -   The default is to use the same name as the original, which is fine.

Changing the name might be more useful if you are forking a project that you intend to develop in a divergent direction from the original.

![Choose a name for the fork. the same name as the original repo is fine.](images/git-r/13_gh_naming-fork.png)

Click the green **Create fork** button at the bottom of the page. There is a check box asking if you want to "copy the main branch only". By default it is ticked. And usually that is what you will want.

![Green "create fork button". Click it!](images/git-r/14_gh_fork-green-button.png)

### Cloning our fork

Now we have our own copy on our own Github account, to get our own copy of this onto our local machine we do the same **clone** process as outlined in steps from [2.3 to 3.1](#preparing-to-clone-the-repository)

## Final set-up tips

Here is a suggested directory structure to think about. You do not have to do this, but it is clear, simple, and easy to compare with your team mates.
