Git is famous for it's weird and opaque jargon.
Listed below are some common terms you will encounter on this course.
The list is not exhaustive, and sacrifices accuracy for expediency.
But it should be enough to get us started.
Words bold are explained somewhere else in this glossary.

__Add__  
The command used to move file changes into the __index__ (aka, __staging area__).
You do this by clicking on the yellow __untracked__ boxes in the Git pane.

__Clone__  
A copy of, or the process of copying, a __remote__ __repository__ stored locally on your machine.
Example: `git clone https://github.com/user/ds-week-03-tutorial`.

__Commit__  
A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
__Commits__ are used to track changes to your project.



__Fork__  
A personal copy of someone elses's __repository__, typically used to contribute or start independent development.
Similar to __clone__, except the fork is your own copy on your own GitHub account.



__Git__  
A version control system used to track changes in code and collaborate with others.

__GitHub__  
A cloud based storage space for Git repositories.



__Icons__  
In the Git pane, Rstudio indicated the current status of each file in your project.
For now there are three states you need to be aware of:

-   ![Untracked](images/git-r/untracked.png) __Untracked__: A file on your system that Git has detected, but is not tracking Click to "add" it the Git database.
-   ![Added](images/git-r/added.png) __Added__: A file that Git has been tagged for commit. Once committed, Git will notice any future changes to it.
-   ![Modified](images/git-r/modified.png) __Modified__: a file that Git has been tracking, and has been changed since the last commit.


__Ignore__  
You do not have to track every file in your project.
You can ignore some by adding their names to the __`.gitignore`__ file.

__Index__  
Also known as the staging area.
It's where changes are prepared before committing.



__Pull__  
Fetches and integrates updates from a __remote__ repository into your local repository.

Can be local or remote (like GitHub).

__Remote__  
A version of your repository that's hosted on the internet (e.g. in GitHub).

The process of adding changed fiiles to the __staging area__ to include them in a __commit__.

__Staging area__  
An "area" (see __index__) where added or modified files are placed to flag that they should be included in the next __commit__.
