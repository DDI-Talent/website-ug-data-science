## Embedding Ethics into Data Sharing

Health data is also being captured outside of the medical encounter, particularly from the digital exhaust trails we leave behind when we interact with online services and technologies. These may be harder to monitor and regulate. For now, pause and think about these questions.

-   How comfortable would you be with your medical data being shared with researchers, with government analysts, or with companies?

-   Would you be willing to accept the risk that even anonymised data could in theory be used to identify you?

-   What types of data use do you think should require your explicit consent?

-   And when is it ethical to routinely capture health data for public benefit?
