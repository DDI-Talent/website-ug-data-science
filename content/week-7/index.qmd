This week you will be introduced to process modelling methods and you will learn about the RDF approach to integrating healthcare data.

## Learning Outcomes

**By the end of the week you will be able to:**

1.  Explain visual representations of healthcare processes, including BPMN and PROforma

2.  Discuss computational methods for analysing and discovering processes based on existing data

3.  Describe data captured in the RDF data model and discuss the advantages that it brings to merging biomedical datasets

4.  Argue about the value that ontologies bring in the precision medicine era

## Structure of this week's materials
