The Scottish Approach to Service Design (SAtSD) is based on a collaborative, inclusive and ethical approach. The resources provided by the Scottish Government state that:

-   Doing research in an ethical manner ensures that:

    -   participants are safe
    -   researchers are safe
    -   research is valid (objectivity and integrity)
    -   research is lawful and transparent
    -   research is inclusive and respectful'

Further information is available from the [Digital Office](https://www.digitaloffice.scot/updates/blog-scottish-approach-to-service-design-19) again with the emphasis on ethical approaches which can include conducting a [Data Protection Impact Assessment](https://www.gov.scot/publications/foi-202000086688-2/) (DPIA) also encouraged by the Information Commissioner's Office. An example of their Regulatory Sandbox activity with JISC looked at [student support and wellbeing.](https://ico.org.uk/media2/for-organisations/documents/2618023/jisc-regulatory-sandbox-final-report.pdf)

During the Covid-19 pandemic, many countries rapidly developed contact tracing apps. The NHS Scotland Test and Protect app focused on [Transparency -- Evidence, Ethics and Impact](https://protect.scot/transparency). An article by Dr Pagliari in the [Journal of Global Health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7510337/#!po=1.61290) considered the ethics and value of these apps.
