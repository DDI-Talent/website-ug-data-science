As its name implies, the BRFSS is designed to identify risk factors in the adult population and report emerging health trends. For example, respondents are asked about their diet and weekly physical activity, their HIV/AIDS status, possible tobacco use, and even their level of healthcare coverage. The BRFSS Web site (<http://www.cdc.gov/brfss>) contains a complete description of the survey, including the research questions that motivate the study and many interesting results derived from the data.\n\nWe will focus on a random sample of 20,000 people from the BRFSS survey conducted in 2000. While there are over 200 variables in this data set, we will work with a small subset.\n\nWe begin by loading the data set of 20,000 observations into the R workspace. After launching RStudio, enter the following command.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(\"http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/cdc.R\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe data set cdc that shows up in your workspace (the Environment tab on the top right) is a data matrix, with each row representing a case (one respondent) and each column representing a variable. R calls this data format a data frame, which is a term that will be used throughout the labs.\n\n## Exercise 1\n\nHow many cases are there in this data set? How many variables? For each variable, identify its data type (e.g. categorical, discrete).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nCreate a numerical summary for height and age, and compute the interquartile range for each. Compute the relative frequency distribution for gender and genhlth. How many males are in the sample? What proportion of the sample reports being in excellent health?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nCreate a new object called under23_and_smoke that contains all observations of respondents under the age of 23 that have smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Write the command you used to create the new object as the answer to this exercise.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 4\n\nFind the formula for BMI and create a new variable called BMI, corresponding to each person's BMI.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nMake a scatterplot of weight versus desired weight. Describe the relationship between these two variables.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nLet’s consider a new variable: the difference between desired weight (wtdesire) and current weight (weight). Create this new variable by subtracting the two columns in the data frame and assigning them to a new column called wdiff.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 7\n\nWhat type of data is wdiff? If an observation wdiff is 0, what does this mean about the person’s weight and desired weight. What if wdiff is positive or negative?\n\n## Exercise 8\n\nDescribe the distribution of wdiff in terms of its center, shape, and spread, including any plots you use. What does this tell us about how people feel about their current weight?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Exercise 9\n\nUsing numerical summaries and a side-by-side box plot, determine if men tend to view their weight differently than women.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
